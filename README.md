# Medical-Expenditure-Regression
A machine learning Model to estimate medical charges  using different regression model i.e, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression and Polynomial Regression.<br>

<b>OVERVIEW</b> <br>
<b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) </b>: Analyzing the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics. <br>
<b>Feature Engineering </b>: Preprocessing and transforming features to enhance model performance. <br>
<b>Hyperparameter Tuning </b>: Optimizing parameters for multiple regression models to improve predictive accuracy.<br>
<b>Ensemble Learning Regression </b>: Building an ensemble regression model using a combination of multiple regression models.<br>

This project will provide insights into medical cost prediction using ensemble regression techniques, leveraging various features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region.<br>
